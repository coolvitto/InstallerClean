/// such a copy is marked, and the declared-product screen compares every file with the
/// packages it opens (<see cref="DeclaredProductCheckTests"/>). A product the registry
/// names that the scan could not ask about is on no list, so nothing compares a file
/// with it, and the whole walk-derived offer is held, installation packages and patch
/// files alike.
