/// THE ACT-TIME HALF OF THE SCAN'S WHOLESALE WITHHOLDING.
///
/// The scan offers no walk-derived file on a machine whose recorded paths it could not
/// settle, or whose registry names a product it could not ask about. This pass re-runs
/// the whole enumeration immediately before a Move or a Delete and asks both questions
/// again, so on a machine that reached one of those states between the list appearing and
/// the button being pressed, the walk-derived files leave the batch as the scan would by
/// then have held them back. Nothing need be wrong with any file in it; the machine has
/// changed underneath it. A second copy the enumeration lists is not one of those
/// states: it is compared file by file by the declared-product screen, which
/// <see cref="RemovableReverifierWalkDerivedTests"/> drives.
///
/// IT DROPS THE WALK-DERIVED HALF AND NOT THE WHOLE BATCH. A superseded registration is
/// judged by its own row in the same enumeration, which takes the row's removable verdict
/// away there on either condition, and the pass drops the file on that row. A path no
/// registration names is the walk-derived half, and that is the test.
///
/// READ WHAT EACH FIXTURE SETS UP. They differ in the census alone, or in whether a
/// registration names the path, and nothing else.
