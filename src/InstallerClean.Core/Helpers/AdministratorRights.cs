/// Whether this process holds administrator rights, meaning its token carries the

/// the rights they refuse to scan.
///
/// THE SCAN'S "NOT INSTALLED" ANSWER IS WHAT RESTS ON IT. The scan asks Windows
/// Installer about products and patches across every account on the machine, and
/// Microsoft documents that asking across accounts needs administrator privileges.
/// An administrator is shown a product installed for another account like any other,
/// and the scan reads a product missing from the answer as installed for no account.
///
/// ENABLED MEMBERSHIP, NOT MEMBERSHIP. IsInRole checks the token with
/// CheckTokenMembership, which counts the group only where it is enabled. Under UAC,
/// an administrator's process started without elevation carries the group deny-only,
/// so it gets false, as a standard account does. An elevated process gets true, and
/// so does one running as LocalSystem, whose token Microsoft documents as including
/// BUILTIN\Administrators, so the command line run as SYSTEM by a scheduled task or a
/// management agent passes.
///
/// Windows neither elevates a running process nor takes its elevation away, so the
/// answer taken at startup holds for every scan the process makes.
