/// composing a line for the main screen and the command line writing to stdout.
/// Rendering the parts here leaves each host only its own joining to do.
///
/// ONE POPULATION, ONE SENTENCE, AND NO CAUSE NAMED. The patch STATE settles nothing
/// on its own: Windows opens every patch registered to a product whether or not it
/// has been superseded, so a superseded registration naming an absent file is a
/// record Windows will act on and cannot satisfy exactly as an applied one is
/// (<see cref="RegisteredPackage.IsMissingFromDisk"/> carries the citations and
/// why no single consequence may be named). The data keeps the split, in
/// <see cref="ScanResult.MissingUnaffectedCount"/> and its sibling; the copy does
/// not.

/// WHAT THE PREDICATE BELOW GRADES IS ONE CASE, NARROWLY, and it is the only thing
/// here that does: the state together with further facts the scan has to establish
/// positively. A summary sits above the predicate and is read first, so it
/// states the part that holds either way and leaves the population to the expression
/// that decides it.
///
/// AND IT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT WHAT REMOVED THEM. Every tool that deletes from this
/// folder leaves an identical record, this one included where it removes a superseded
/// patch whose registration Windows keeps, so the app cannot tell whose work it is
/// looking at and must not imply it can. It fires on machines this app has never run

    /// nothing could reach for the file: the state is superseded or obsoleted AND every
    /// product sharing the patch was shown to hold no patch that could be uninstalled.
    ///
    /// Neither half of that conjunction is enough alone. The state is not: Windows opens
    /// every patch registered to a product whether or not it has been superseded, so a
    /// superseded file's absence is harmless only where nothing sharing the patch could
    /// roll back onto it. Nor is the app's own removable verdict: an obsoleted patch is
    /// not removable for a policy reason rather than a dangerous one, so that verdict
    /// says nothing about whether its absence matters.
    ///
    /// AND AN UNESTABLISHED VERDICT IS AFFECTED, deliberately, which is the opposite
    /// direction from the offer. Both refuse to claim what the app has not shown: there
    /// that the file is spare, here that its absence is harmless.
    ///
    /// AND A WITHHELD ROW IS AFFECTED WHATEVER ITS VERDICT SAYS, EXCEPT WHERE THE ONLY
    /// CAUSE WAS THE UNREAD PATCH FILE. That exception is the last conjunct. The pass that
    /// confirms a removable verdict reads the patch file to ask which products it
    /// declares, and withholds where it cannot. For a row this exception decides, the
    /// first conjunct has already found the file GONE, so the read it failed is a read of
    /// the very file whose absence is the subject: there is nothing there to open, and
    /// the read fails for a file this app removed exactly as it fails for one anything
    /// else removed. Such a row is judged on the verdict it was positively given.
    ///
    /// AND THE PASS RECORDS THAT CAUSE ONLY AFTER ASKING. It puts the patch, under every
    /// code naming the file, to every installation it can name without the file, and
    /// records the unread file as the cause only where every one of them answered and none
    /// holds the patch. An installation that holds it makes the row a claim, carrying its
    /// state where that state is the stronger reading and the installation's own claim
    /// never reached the merge, and one that did not answer withholds the row without the
    /// cause.
    ///
    /// SO THE ROW KEEPS THAT VERDICT, on a run that came up short elsewhere as much as on
    /// one that did not. The scan-wide withholding takes the removable verdict off every
    /// row still carrying one and leaves this marker alone. It fires on two machine-level
    /// conditions. The terms of the first are a product the enumeration DID return whose
    /// lost records the registry does not hold, a product it returned whose installations
    /// the keyed ask did not settle and whose registry entry names a cached file the
    /// enumeration never claimed that is on the disk, a product the registry names that
    /// the scan could not settle, and a cached patch file no product the scan asks is
    /// recorded as holding; none of them is "a holder of this patch went unseen", so none
    /// of them bears on this file. The second, a recorded path the scan could not settle,
    /// can be exactly that holder, and the holder's registration then
    /// reaches this predicate through the row it lands on: where this file has gone, a
    /// registration that means it but is kept in the unsettled spelling names the same
    /// absent file, or names nothing, so that row reads missing too and is judged here on
    /// its own terms. An applied row whose file is missing is always reported. Such a run
    /// removes no superseded patch at all.
    ///
    /// THE EVIDENCE IS OF THE KIND THE OFFER ACTS ON. The verdict that keeps this row out
    /// of the count is the per-product verdict a superseded patch has to carry to be
    /// offered for permanent removal. It is re-established from the machine's own records
    /// on every run: nothing here remembers what the app removed. And this predicate
    /// speaks only about a file that has already gone, so it bears on no offer.
    ///
    /// A ROW WITHHELD FOR ANY OTHER CAUSE IS REPORTED. Where the machine-wide patch
    /// enumeration did not answer, the confirmation pass downgrades every removable path
    /// with no marker set, so such a row arrives here withheld and unmarked and is
    /// reported: that run failed to establish something about this patch itself. A row
    /// downgraded because its patch set could not be established is reported too, by the
    /// verdict clause above rather than by this one.
    ///
    /// THE FLAG NAMES A CAUSE AND THIS LINE DECIDES WHAT THE CAUSE MEANT, because it

    /// conjunct leaves it out. See

    /// did not answer; none of those brought a state to put on the row. Such a row carries
